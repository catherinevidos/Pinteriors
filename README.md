<h1><a href='https://pinteriors.herokuapp.com/#/' target='_blank'>Welcome to Pinteriors :pushpin:</a></h1>
Pinteriors is a <a href='https://www.pinterest.com' target='_blank'>Pinterest</a> clone built specifically with interior designers in mind. You can use it as a digital pinboard to keep track of your photos and design ideas. The site is built with Ruby on Rails on the backend, with PostgreSQL and AWS S3 for data storage and React/Redux on the frontend along with HTML/CSS. The app is deployed using Heroku.
